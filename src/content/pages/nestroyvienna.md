title: About the project
---

The project utilizes digital tools for extraction and georeferencing of the information (place
names, persons and institutions https://pmb.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/ ), which concern the Viennese context
and references by Nestroy in his plays and letters. The outcome of the project aspires to create a
substantial supplement for the personal names and toponyms indices of the Historical-Critical
edition of Nestroyâ€™s works (HKA, 1977ff), and to visualise and interconnect the Viennese background
information in the works of the playwright, a crucial fact for further sociolinguistic and literary
approaches.
