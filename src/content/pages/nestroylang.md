title: About the project
---

The project investigates of the language used in the theatrical corpus of the Austrian singer, actor
and playwright Johann Nepomuk Eduard Ambrosius Nestroy (1801 – 1862). A representative range of
registers, technical languages, sociolects, and (comical) idiolects will be described and analyzed.
The resulting portrayal of the language use in Nestroy’s plays will deepen our understanding of
various socio-cultural phenomena reflected in his work.
